# NEURAL NETWORK CHARITY ANALYSIS

## OVERVIEW OF ANALYSIS 

The purpose of this analysis is to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.


## RESULTS

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model? 
The "IS_SUCCESSFUL" variable was the feature of the model. 

What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
The columns "NAME" and "EIN" were removed from the input data. 

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
